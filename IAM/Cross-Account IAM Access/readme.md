#  Cross-Account IAM Access
Chevron has multiple AWS accounts for development, testing, and production, I encountered a challenge in facilitating secure resource sharing between accounts. I used cross-account IAM roles to establish controlled access between these accounts. By configuring trust relationships and defining permissions in the destination accounts, I enabled developers to work seamlessly across environments without compromising security. This approach also helped in managing costs by avoiding duplicative resources in different accounts.
