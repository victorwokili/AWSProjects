# Secure Data Archiving with AWS S3

At IBM, I was tasked with securely archiving critical business data for long-term retention for one of my clients. I implemented an AWS S3 storage solution to store this data cost-effectively and securely. To enhance data security, I configured versioning and cross-region replication, ensuring data durability and disaster recovery capabilities. Additionally, I utilized S3 lifecycle policies to automate the transition of older data to lower-cost storage classes like S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. This not only saved costs but also ensured compliance with data retention policies.

My end goal was to transition older data to lower-cost storage classes for long-term retention and compliance with data retention policies. Create a secure, cost-effective, and compliant data archiving solution using AWS S3 that ensures long-term data retention and disaster recovery capabilities.
